# week9-backend-project

PawPii is a group project that utilizes various front end and back end technologies such as NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgresQL, 
CSS/Bootstrap and various other Node Packages.

The purpose of this project is to provide a resource where various Dog Shelters can post their respective dogs to the database.
Organizations/Dog Shelters can either add or delete dogs from the database whenever a dog gets adopted and or new dogs enter
their shelter. A regular user who is not an organization can also register and view detailed information about dogs located 
in different shelters in different states. A regular user may not add/delete dogs from the database, but they are allowed
to add dogs to their personal favorites list, easily accessible to them at a later time.Adding to favorites will
create an entry in the linking table "favorites" which is linked to a "dogs" table and the "users" table.

We intend to expand on this project and add OAUTH using passportJS to increase potential user options when signing up for 
the service.
